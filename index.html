            <p>Vaping is often seen as a safer option than smoking, but it is still very bad for your health. Most vapes contain nicotine, which is a drug that makes people feel good for a short time but is also very addictive. This means once you start, it can be really hard to stop. Vapes also have other harmful chemicals that can hurt your lungs and heart</p>
            <p> Some of these chemicals are the same ones found in cleaning products or car exhaust. Many people, especially teens, are drawn to vaping because of the fruity flavors, cool packaging, and the belief that it’s not dangerous. But just because it tastes sweet or smells good doesn’t mean it’s safe. </p>

            <p>Vaping is bad for your health because it exposes your lungs to harmful chemicals, including nicotine, which is highly addictive. Vaping can make it hard to breathe, cause coughing or chest pain, and affect how your brain works, especially while it’s still growing. </p>
            <p>Despite being marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, vaping still carries serious health risks and long-term effects that aren't fully understood yet. Over time, vaping can lead to serious health problems like lung disease, heart issues, and more. It is important to understand the truth about vaping before trying it, even once.</p>
