            <p>There are many problems with vaping including dangerous side effects that will harm you for life. Nicotine is the primary source of e-cigarettes and cigarettes are highly addictive. It causes you to crave smoke and suffer hazardous symptoms if you ignore the craving. Raising your blood pressure and spiking your adrenaline, which increases your heart rate and the likelihood of having a heart attack.</p>
            <p>Vaping is particularly concerning for young people whose brains are still developing. Nicotine exposure during young adulthood can interfere with brain development, potentially affecting memory, attention, and learning. It can also increase the likelihood of addiction to other substances later in life. Disposable vapes contribute to pollution, as they are not capable of being broken down and can end up in landfills, causing environmental harm. The e-cigarette industry also uses a lot of plastic and lithium batteries, which can contribute to waste and pollution. </p>

            <p>While e-cigarettes generally have fewer chemicals than traditional cigarettes, they still contain a variety of substances that could be harmful when inhaled, including: Formaldehyde (a carrigan) Acetaldehyde and Heavy Metals like lead ( from the heating elements ). These substances may contribute to cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there have been reports of a condition called EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury), which has led to hospitalizations and even deaths. Since vaping is relatively new, the long-term health effects are not fully understood. While it may seem like a less harmful alternative to smoking, the cumulative effects of vaping over many years are still unknown. </p>
