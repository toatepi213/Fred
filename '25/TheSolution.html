            <p>If you ever feel the urge to vape, make a quitting plan. Distractions like going on a walk, going on your phone, or at least something to keep your hands busy to manage your addiction to vaping. Celebrate your wins. Reward yourself everyday with something little. Each day without vaping is a step closer to achieving your goal. Treat yourself or celebrate with your friends. Solving the vaping problem takes a combination of education, laws, and support. First, schools and communities need to teach young people about the serious health risks of vaping, including addiction and lung damage</p>
            <p>Governments can help by creating and enforcing strict rules—like banning flavored vapes that attract teens, raising the legal age to buy them, and limiting advertising. It’s also important to support people who already vape and want to quit by offering resources like counseling, support groups, or nicotine patches and gum. Parents and role models can also help by talking openly about the dangers of vaping. When all these efforts work together, vaping can be reduced, especially among young people.</p>

            <p>Vaping is a serious problem, especially for young people. The best way to solve it is by using a mix of education, rules, and support. 
             First, schools, parents, and communities need to teach kids and teens about the hazards of vaping. Many people think vaping is safe, but it can harm the lungs, cause addiction, and affect brain development in young people. When people understand the risks, they are less likely to start. </p>
            <p>Next, strong rules are important. Governments can make laws to stop companies from selling vapes to kids, ban flavors that attract young people, and make sure ads don’t make vaping look cool or fun. Diaries also need to follow the law and not sell vapes to anyone under the legal age. Finally, people who already vape need help to quit. Quitting can be hard because vaping contains nicotine, which is addictive. Support from doctors, counselors, or quit programs can really help. Things like nicotine patches, gum, or talking to someone who understands can make a big difference in you.</p>
