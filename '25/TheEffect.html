            <p>Vaping is not safe and can harm your health. It involves inhaling vaporized liquid that usually contains nicotine, which is highly addictive. Nicotine can affect your brain, especially in teenagers and young adults, and harm memory, focus, and mood. Even if you choose "nicotine-free" vapes, they still contain harmful chemicals which can cause serious damage to your lungs and heart. Vaping can also lead to shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and even lung inflammation.</p>
            <p>The risks don't stop there. Vaping has been linked to a condition called "EVALI" (e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury), which has caused serious health problems and even death. Long-term vaping can increase the risk of chronic lung conditions, like asthma, and can contribute to heart disease. While some people use vaping to quit smoking, itâ€™s not a safe method. Studies show that many who vape still end up smoking traditional cigarettes. The safest choice is to avoid vaping and smoking altogether. Vaping can lead to dry mouth, gum inflammation, and increase the risk of cavities and tooth decay. It can also cause irritation in the throat and mouth.</p>

        <div class="paragraph_3">
            <p>Vaping has become particularly popular among teenagers, leading to concerns about early nicotine addiction. Studies show that young people who vape are more likely to start smoking traditional cigarettes later on. Moreover, the attractive flavors and sleek design of vaping devices make them appealing to younger audiences, contributing to the rise of youth vaping. Many vaping products, especially those bought online or from unregulated sources, may contain unknown or dangerous substances, increasing the risk of negative health effects.</p>
            <p>While vaping might be less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes, it's not risk-free. The chemicals in e-cigarettes can have negative effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, especially with long-term use. Nicotine addiction is a significant concern, and there are potential risks to oral health and overall well-being. Vaping should be approached with caution, particularly for young people, pregnant women, and individuals with existing health conditions.</p>
